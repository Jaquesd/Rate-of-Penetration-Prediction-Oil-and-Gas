# Rate-of-Penetration-Prediction-Oil-and-Gas
The project aims to use machine learning to predict the Rate of Penetration (ROP) during well drilling in the Oil and Gas industry. The goal is to enhance the accuracy of ROP predictions to improve cost estimation, budgeting, and project planning for future drilling operations.
